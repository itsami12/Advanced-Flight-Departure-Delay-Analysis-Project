# Advanced Flight Departure Delay Analysis Project

---

## Project Overview

Flight delays are a critical issue in aviation, affecting passengers, airlines, and operational efficiency. This project addresses these challenges by:

1. **Analyzing Flight Data:** Integration of multiple datasets (flight, test, and weather data) to identify key patterns contributing to delays.
2. **Predictive Modeling:** Building classification and regression models to predict delays.
3. **Model Optimization:** Using advanced techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to improve model performance.
4. **Kaggle Submission:** Predicting delays on test data and submitting results to Kaggle competitions for evaluation.

## Features

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and formatting time fields.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating temporal features (hour, day, month), integrating weather data, and calculating departure delays.
- **Data Integration:** Merging weather data with flight data for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visualizations:** 
  - Histograms for delay distributions.
  - Temporal patterns across days, hours, and months.
  - Delay comparisons across airlines and airports.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Relationships between weather and delay data using various visualizations.
  ### Model used:
  1. **Random Forest
  2. **Linear Regression
  3. **Logistic Regression

### Predictive Modeling
1. **Binary Classification:** Predict whether a flight is delayed (on-time vs. delayed).
2. **Multi-Class Classification:** Classify delays into categories (No Delay, Short Delay, Moderate Delay, Long Delay).
3. **Regression Analysis:** Predict the exact delay duration.

### Model Evaluation
- Metrics include accuracy, precision-recall, F1-score, MAE, and RMSE.
- Performance evaluation using cross-validation and confusion matrices.

### Model Optimization
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Grid search and random search.
- **Validation:** K-fold cross-validation for reliable performance assessment.
